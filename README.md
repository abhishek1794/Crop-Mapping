# Crop-Mapping
It was a classification problem based on the “Crop mapping using fused optical-radar dataset”. The dataset contained bi-temporal Remote Sensing information that has more than 3 lakh observations and 175 attributes. Dimensionality optimization was done to mitigate collinearity. Feature assessment shows that some variables are skewed. After EDA and preprocessing, the classification model was developed using RF and ANN. 
	The ANN performed slightly better than RF. It was evidently superior in predicting misrepresented classes (Broadleaf and Pea).
Key skills: EDA, data preprocessing, RF, Artificial Neural Network
